Post Project Reflection: 

After completing this project, I learned a ton about how command line and git work within a project. Understanding when and the most efficient way to execute commits through the building phase is something that I struggle with and will need to improve on. Overall, the HTML code itself was straight forward and the pages were simple to build out.
